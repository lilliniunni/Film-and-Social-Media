## How to run

If you would like to run the visualization that I have created, please clone the repo and set up a simple local server. An example Python command for hosting a local server is shown below:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Note that based on your current Python version, the `python3` command may need to be adjusted to fit your current version.

Once you have the server set up, simply go to the address that you have created. In this case, you would want to type `localhost:8080` in your browser.

From there, you can start clicking on each individual project and browse the `.html` files to view the visualizations.
